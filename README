NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaResourcesFromGit - Metadata resource URLs from
    Git configuration

VERSION
    version 1.103590

SYNOPSIS
    In your "dist.ini" or "profile.ini":

     [MetaResourcesFromGit]

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin is a drop-in replacement for
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaResources for users of Git. It provides three
    resource links to your distribution metadata, based on the name of the
    distribution and the remote URL of the Git repository you are working
    from.

    The default links are equivalent to:

     homepage       = http://github.com/%a/%r/wiki
     bugtracker.web = https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=%N
     repository.url = git://github.com/%a/%r.git

CONFIGURATION
  Plugin Options
    "name"
        The name of your Perl distribution in the format used by CPAN. It
        defaults to the "name" option you have provided in "dist.ini".

    "remote"
        The alias of the Git remote URL from which the working repository is
        cloned. It defaults to "origin".

    "homepage"
        A link on the CPAN page of your distribution, defaulting to the wiki
        page of a constructed <http://github.com> repository for your code.
        You can use the formatting options below when overriding this value.

    "bugtracker.web"
        A link on the CPAN page of your distribution, defaulting to its
        corresponding <http://rt.cpan.org> homepage. You can use the
        formatting options below when overriding this value.

    "repository.url"
        A link on the CPAN page of your distribution, defaulting to the
        read-only clone URL belonging to a contructed <http://github.com>
        repository for your code. You can use the formatting options below
        when overriding this value.

  Formatting Options
    The following codes may be used when overriding the "homepage",
    "bugtracker.web", and "repository.url" configuration options.

    %a  The "account" (username) as parsed from the remote repository URL in
        the local Git configuration. This is currently (probably)
        GitHub-centric.

    %r  The "repository" (or, project name) as parsed from the remote
        repiository URL in the local Git configuration. This is currently
        (probably) GitHub-centric.

    %N  The name of the distribution as given to the "name" option in your
        "dist.ini" file. You can also use "%{lc}N" or "%{uc}N" to get the
        name in lower or upper case respectively, or "%{deb}N" to get the
        name in a Debian GNU/Linux package-name format ("lib-foo-bar-perl").

TODO
    *   Make things less GitHub-centric. Patches welcome!

THANKS
    To "cjm" from IRC for suggesting this as a better way to achieve my
    requirements.
